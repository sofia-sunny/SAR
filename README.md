# SAR
Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis is a fundamental approach in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery that examines how specific structural features of a molecule influence its biological activity. By systematically modifying parts of a compound—such as functional groups, substituents, or stereochemistry—and evaluating the resulting changes in potency, selectivity, or pharmacokinetic properties, researchers can identify which chemical elements are essential for activity and which can be optimized or replaced. SAR studies not only guide the rational design of more effective and safer drug candidates but also provide deeper mechanistic insights into how molecules interact with their biological targets, forming the foundation for iterative cycles of lead optimization
